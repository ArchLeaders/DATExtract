# DATExtract

Library for viewing and extracting the contents of .DAT Archives from Traveller's Tales games.

PLEASE NOTE THIS IS NOT A FULLY-FLEDGED PROGRAM FOR YOU TO USE!

You are probably looking for [DATManager](https://github.com/connorh315/datmanager). But if you're not, look around, stay for a while.

Code usage can be found in DATManager as it's a bit complex to be explained in a README, I'll write up some proper documentation soon.

Implements LZ2K code that has been ported from [QuickBMS](https://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm).
